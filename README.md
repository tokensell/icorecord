ICO review steps:

1. Product. Things I am looking for in the product before ICO:
Unique idea, blockchain usage, open-source.
Product should solve some important problem.
The market is ready for that product or will be ready in the next 24 months.
Product is not dependent on other blockchain solving their problems.
There is positive feedback from the community about the product.

2. The Market:
How big is the potential market?
How many competitors are at that market now?
Project team should have realistic plans on how this market will be captured.

3. Token should be used within the product ecosystem. It means that project can not work without that token. That will allow the demand to increase while project will be developing.

4. RoadMap usually contains milestones that makes the token price go up. That is why having RoadMap with concrete goals within time periods is important.

5. Project Team should contain people with experience and knowledge in selected market. It is preferable that there are blockchain developers, managers, CEO with entrepreneur experience. All missing experience and knowledge team does not have should be covered by people from the advisory board.

6. Current project status. Do they have MVP (minimum viable product), partners, are they presented in the mass media or conferences.

7. Token Distribution and ICO conditions. This part completely depends on why do you invest during ICO. Do you want quick exit to sell tokens right after they will be traded on one of the exchanges? Or do you believe in the project and team and want to buy and hold for several years? It is up to you. Escrow is another thing I would recommend everybody to notice. Having no escrow can make all investors money disappear right after the ICO.
